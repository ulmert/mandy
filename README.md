# Mandy
An **experimental MIDI chord sequencer** sketch for the  **Midiboy** (Arduino) platform - written to act as a small hub generating notes in a semi randomised fashion (e.g. triggering a setup with multiple mono synths and sources).

In its essence, notes are derived from chords programmed in the step sequencer which are automatically assigned to tracks (all chords consist of 3 notes). Notes are then triggered by applying track specific patterns, lengths and tempo dividers in order to achieve a fair amount of varied MIDI output.

In addition, tracks can be routed to different MIDI channels using random or fixed modes, making it easy to achieve polyphony among several sound sources.

Mandy also supports external MIDI control (sync, play / stop and note offset).
